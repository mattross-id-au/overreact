                <p><del>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption. You can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to an HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, this section will help you get started.</del></p>
                <p><ins>You don't need to install anything! Web Components often seem more complex than they need to, particularly when grappling with <code>ShadowRoot</code>s and <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tags, but in realtiy your code will be cleaner if you don't use them.</ins></p>
