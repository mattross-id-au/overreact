                <p>This is a remake of the official <a href="https://react.dev/learn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React Quick Start tutorial</a> but using standard <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Components</a> instead of React components.</p>
                <p>Today, you can do a lot with standard in-browser HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No build tools, transpilers or complex hosting required. The code you write is the code that ships.</p>

                <h1>Installation</h1>

                <p><del>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption. You can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to an HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, this section will help you get started.</del></p>
                <p><ins>You don't need to install anything! Web Components often seem more complex than they need to, particularly when grappling with <code>ShadowRoot</code>s and <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tags, but in realtiy your code will be cleaner if you don't use them.</ins></p>
